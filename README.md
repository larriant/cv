# My [CV](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/cv.pdf)
Generated using [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV#readme). All credit goes to [Byungjin Park](https://github.com/posquit0).

To generate the CV, you need TeX distribution installed. I installed mine with [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), by running:
`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.texlive-combined-full-2017`

Assuming you have it installed, you can run:
`xelatex cv.tex`

This will create `cv.pdf` file which can be seen live [here](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/cv.pdf).
